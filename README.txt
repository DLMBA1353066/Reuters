README - Reuters 21578

In file Reut-Classification_TM is presented in detail the set of instructions used to perform a classification taks and topic model on the reuters dataset.
In the first part is reported the code for correctly read the Reuters-21578 dataset and for the pre-processing part.
Then, in the second the three clustering algorithm are presented in any aspect: the values of parameters we need to specify, the construction of the confusion matrix, and the computation of the Precision, Recall, Accuracy and F-Measure for each class and also for Micro and Macro averaging.
Thirdly, we present the code for Topic Models.

In file Reut-Clustering is presented the set of instructions for clustering part.
The first section is similar as in file Reut-Classification_TM, with the pre-processing operations.
The second part performs the Cluster Analysis in three different method: Hierarchical, K-Means and PAM.
Also, is reported the R code for the contingencty table, the computation and plot of the silhouette and the computation of the Weighted Average Entroy.

In both the files are specified the libraries to install for the analysis.
The code may be copied-and-pasted as it is, and then executed.
